Welcome to Name Generator's documentation!
==========================================

**Name Generator** simply creates random names upon request.  This can
and does have a roof depending on whether the names are to be unique.
Once this is identified, depending on the number of values in each
source file(which should match).  A simple combination calculation
needs to be made to determine the outcome.

**Example:**
            | 100 first names in first_names.py
            | 100 last names in last_names.py
            | 100 total names
            | Unique Combinations: 9,900
            | Combinations: 499,950

**Note:** This can be modified by increasing or decresing the names.  It
would be a good idea to keep the files equal in length.  If not you will
not get far.
